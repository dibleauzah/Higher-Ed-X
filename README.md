# Higher-Ed-X
My role: Idea-originator/founding-partner, and co-developer with Gabriel Ratz and Clinton Adeleke (GitHub handle: htmlHxcker).
Details:
This venture is the latest iteration of a higher-education consulting business. The new app is targeted towards two main groups of clients, namely: 1)--US-native and international students for assistance with higher-education planning and applications, and 2)--College/university admissions officials, as well as high-school academic counselors (who assist college/university-bound students).
